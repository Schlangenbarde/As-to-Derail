  text: "My daughter got lost, as well.\r\nI swore to God I would look for her, until
    the tunnels flood.\r\nAnd God swore to me I would find her, until I flood the
    tunnels.\r\nI still hear their voices. They\u2019re stuck in my head.\r\nI still
    smell their blood. It\u2019s stuck to my hands.\r\nYou would be surprised how
    much there is.\r\nOnce you start, it just starts to come out, and for some it
    never stops.\r\nIt flows and flows, from one to the next,\r\nUntil the tunnels
    flood.\r"
