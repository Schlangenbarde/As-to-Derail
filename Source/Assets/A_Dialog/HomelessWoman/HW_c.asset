  text: "Twenty years, I had been looking for my son. I saw my skin age and crumble
    and rust, but I would not have known a night had passed. I wish the rules were
    different down here. That, without water or sleep, I wouldn\u2019t have made
    it to here. I wish that time would pass for the living. Or - for the dead. You
    do not want to find your sister. You don\u2019t want her to find you. Do not
    descend."
